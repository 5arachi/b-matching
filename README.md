# b-matching
The general b-matching problem we consider here is defined as follows: 
We are given a directed graph G = (V,E), capacity b_v for each vertex v, edge cost c_e and capacity u_e for each edge e. The task is to pick copies of edges such that each edge e is picked at most u_e times and for each vertex v, the copies of edges entering v minus the copies of edges leaving v is b_v. We are looking for a solution with minimum cost.
